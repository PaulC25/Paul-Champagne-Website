        <p>
            Hi, my name is Paul Champagne, and this is my personal website.<br>
            <br>
            I'm a fourth year student at Northeastern University, studying Finance and Data Science. <br>
            <br>
            Since high school, I've always been interested in financial markets and was determined to pursue majoring in it as I entered college. As I started to gain more and more knowledge in the field, I realized how much data was involved in being able to analyze the price of stock, the state of the economy, or any other type of analysis I wanted to make. It didn't take long to realize that data science would be a great way to tackle the questions I had. Ever since, I’ve been keen in using programming to help answer those questions and research suitable investing strategies and theories. Through this website, I hope to show how I’ve been able to combine both subjects to create meaningful projects.<br>
            <br>
            Overall, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection between both fields, and here you will find some of the projects I have worked on throughout the last couple years that showcase the skills I've obtained throughout my college and professional career.<br>
            <br>
            Please feel free to reach out to me by email or LinkedIn!<br>
